I attended the Plasma sprint with my brother [Derek](https://kenoi.dev) this year in Graz, Austria!

See my other post for the [details on the sprint itself](/posts/2025/05/plasma-sprint/). This post is about some of the travel that I did while I had the chance to visit Europe!

## Day 0 - Travelling to Graz via Vienna

The day before, I had just finished my final university exams and moved back home! I then set out to downtown Toronto's Billy Bishop Airport, where I took a small propellor plane to Montreal, where I transferred onto a flight to Vienna.

After arriving in Vienna, I took the OBB RailJet to Graz arriving in the afternoon. At least, that was the plan... I was able to buy tickets from the counter at the airport, where they gave me a print-out itinerary to follow. What I didn't realize was that the tickets were valid for trains in that direction, I did not need to necessarily follow the itinerary they gave (which had 2 tight transfers in Vienna!). In the rush to make the second transfer, I accidentally got on a train headed to Salzburg (which is 4 hours from Graz). I luckily caught the mistake when we were in the Viennese suburbs, and so after another two transfers, we got on the correct train.

It was an absolutely stunning ride through the picturesque Austrian countryside, passing through valleys, rivers, castles and more! I would highly recommend taking this route as an attraction on its own.

Upon arriving, we were just completely exhausted, and so we retired at our hotel [Ibis Styles Graz Messe](https://www.booking.com/hotel/at/ibis-styles-graz-messe.html), which was a half-hour tram ride from the train station. I was really impressed by the traditional (medieval?) architecture while riding the tram through the city centre, as well as the tram itself. It operated at a speed through traffic that Toronto streetcars could only envy, lol

The hotel itself is quite spacious and laid-back - it was a low travel season so had most of the place to ourselves.

At night, I went to a rooftop bar and met a couple of contributors, while gazing over a beautiful view of the city.

## Day 1 - 

In the morning, I went with my brother to visit Schlossberg, a beautiful park in the city centre with a massive hilltop castle that overlooks its surroundings. We took the entrance from the public fountain, which involved climbing a massive amount of stairs to the top. It was tiring but a good way to shake off the jet lag! The view from the top was stunning.

The university was closed on this day for Easter, and so the sprint organizers were able to get us access to a hackerspace in the afternoon! The place was super super cool.

I reviewed and tested some merge requests ([Micah](https://invent.kde.org/micahstanley) has been on fire lately!), and then started to do some preliminary digging into some issues with Bhushan and Luis.

## Day 2-5 - Plasma sprinting

We spent most of our time at the TU Graz campus just behind the hotel, hacking on Plasma! I really enjoyed the breakfast provided at the hotel, there was a lot of options (especially since there were not many guests around). We usually got lunch on campus, and then went somewhere nice for dinner.

## Day 6 - Enroute to Vienna

After checking out of our hotel, we walked through the old city centre of Graz with our suitcases. We didn't anticipate the rock tile sidewalks, needless to say, my suitcase wheels did not enjoy that :^)

I had bought a train ticket for the Graz to Vienna "direction", which included being able to get on and off whenever during the day. This gave me the flexibility to be able to have a pitstop at the Lurgrotte Peggau cave system, located in a small village just north of Graz. We dragged our suitcases all the way to the cave entrance, and joined a tour group descending into the cave. The cave was quite deep and damp, but was well lit and paved (I can't imagine exploring this with just flashlights and without railings). Our tour lasted about an hour, but apparently there are ones for the entire day that go through the entire length to the other side of the mountain, which is just insane. The experience really resonated with the inner Minecraft in me.

After that, we had Austrian food at a local lunch spot in the village, before taking the train the rest of the way to Vienna.

## Day 7-8 - Vienna

We were able to visit a bunch of attractions:

I have to be honest, I was really impressed by the architecture in Vienna. It probably eclipses even Paris for me...

On the second day, we took it easy and also had the chance to do our laundry.

We left on a night train to Amsterdam

## Day 9-10 - Amsterdam

## Overall

I really enjoyed the trip! The weather at this time of year is also perfect, not too cold and not too hot!

10/10 would do again
