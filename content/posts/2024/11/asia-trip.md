My brother graduated high school this year, and so he had some time to do a graduation trip during his summer break before starting university. It just so happened that I could get the entire month of August free by shuffling around some internship start and end dates! 

And thus... we went to travel around Asia for the entire month of August! I had never been to Korea and Japan before, and so I was really excited to finally get the chance to visit.
