> TLDR: ProtectionStones is in maintenance mode, my interest in maintaining the project has waned as I have not hosted a Minecraft server for over 4 years. I will still try my best to upgrade the plugin and fix critical issues when I have the time, but do not expect major updates or consistent support on the Discord channel.

In 2018, I found myself in need of a protection plugin for a Minecraft server I was working on. The most popular option I found then was GriefPrevention, however it felt a bit clunky for my needs, as I just wanted something really simple and easy to understand how to use. I had played on a server in the past that used ProtectionStones, which I found really intuitive! And so, I wanted to bring it here.

However,

### Picking up a dead project

The first iteration of ProtectionStones was first developed in 2012

### Maintaining a thing for free

### Community

I encourage developers to fork the plugin
