I am going to be attending Akademy 2022 in person!

This is my first time going to Akademy in-person, so it is quite exciting! 
I will be doing a talk with Bhushan on the state of [Plasma Mobile](https://plasma-mobile.org).

A bit of background on my experience at KDE:

I first started contributing to KDE in 2020, creating the [KClock](https://invent.kde.org/plasma-mobile/kclock) project 
as a way to learn Qt Quick, and to pick up one of the pending tasks of Plasma Mobile.

Through 2020, I worked on many Plasma Mobile applications such as [KWeather](https://invent.kde.org/plasma-mobile/kweather), and also started poking around contributing to the shell.
I also did some work for the desktop, including some work on adding fingerprint support to the users kcm.

In 2021 and 2022, I got much more heavily involved in KDE frameworks (namely [Kirigami](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami)) and Plasma Mobile shell contributions.

One of the most exciting developments in the project over the past few years has been the expansion in the number of devices that can now run Plasma Mobile. I will be sure to bring some devices I have for demo purposes :3

Overall, I am very excited to be able to share a lot of the work that has been done at this year's Akademy! Be sure to check out my talk!
