Hello!

I just wanted to give a somewhat of a personal update on how things are going.

As you may have noticed, I have been somewhat absent from Plasma Mobile development since March. It appears that not much has happened in the project while I was gone, a sombre reminder that there are not many maintainers left that do mobile work. :sweat:

It was around the time that Plasma 6 porting work really started to pick up, and where things were changing and breaking on a daily basis, which made it really hard for me to keep up.

In May, I went back to a school term at university, and was unfortunately too busy to work on Plasma Mobile at all.

However, starting last month, I have picked up working on Plasma Mobile again! I am on another internship term that ends in December, so I am trying my best to get the project in good enough shape for the Plasma 6 release next year (I go back to a school term in January).

In the next few days, I will be detailing some of the tasks I have been working on!

I've been travelling a lot recently...
